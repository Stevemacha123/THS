        <h1>History of Thika High School</h1>
        <p>
          Thika High school is a boys boarding school located in Thika town in
          Kiambu county. The scool was founded in 1951 while Kenya was still a
          British colony. It was founded by the alliance of protestant churches
          and then the church of Scotland mission (commonly known as the
          presbyterian church of East Africa or PCEA). It was originally set as
          the site of the current Thogoto Teachers College but due to its close
          proximity to Alliance boys high school, (another PCEA boys school) it
          was moved to Thika. Thika High school has been known for its academic
          and sports excellence since it's foundation. Today, Thika High school
          has over 1,500 students and around 200 teaching and non-teaching
          staff. The current principal is Mr. Julius Muraya and Mr. Theuri is
          the current deputy principal. Thika High school over the years has
          experienced a gradual growth in both student and staff numbers and
          also a growth in the institution's infrastructure.
